# Hearing Vera Molnár
      

Vera Molnár is one of the earliest pioneers of digital art. In 
[Un Deux Trois](https://www.artsy.net/artwork/vera-molnar-un-deux-trois-b), she draws 
3 kinds of lines, each in its own third of the canvas.
        
In this demo, you will hear a musical trio generated with [Magenta.js](http://magenta.tensorflow.org). Each of the 3 instruments represents one of the 
3 types of lines. As the music progresses, the painting comes to life.
