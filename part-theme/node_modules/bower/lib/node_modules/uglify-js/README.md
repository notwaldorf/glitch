UglifyJS 2
==========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2)

UglifyJS is a JavaScript parser, minifier, compressor or beautifier toolkit.

This page documents the command line utility.  For
[API and internals documentation see my website](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/).
There's also an
[in-browser online demo](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/#demo) (for Firefox,
Chrome and probably Safari).

Install
-------

First make sure you have installed the latest version of [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
(You may need to restart your computer after this step).

From NPM for use as a command line app:

    npm install uglify-js -g

From NPM for programmatic use:

    npm install uglify-js

From Git:

    git clone git://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git
    cd UglifyJS2
    npm link .

Usage
-----

    uglifyjs [input files] [options]

UglifyJS2 can take multiple input files.  It's recommended that you pass the
input files first, then pass the options.  UglifyJS will parse input files
in sequence and apply any compression options.  The files are parsed in the
same global scope, that is, a reference from a file to some
variable/function declared in another file will be matched properly.

If you want to read from STDIN instead, pass a single dash instead of input
files.

If you wish to pass your options before the input files, separate the two with
a double dash to prevent input files being used as option arguments:

    uglifyjs --compress --mangle -- input.js

The available options are:

```
  --source-map                  Specify an output file where to generate source
                                map.
  --source-map-root             The path to the original source to be included
                                in the source map.
  --source-map-url              The path to the source map to be added in //#
                                sourceMappingURL.  Defaults to the value passed
                                with --source-map.
  --source-map-include-sources  Pass this flag if you want to include the
                                content of source files in the source map as
                                sourcesContent property.
  --source-map-inline           Write base64-encoded source map to the end of js output.
  --in-source-map               Input source map, useful if you're compressing
                                JS that was generated from some other original
                                code.
  --screw-ie8                   Use this flag if you don't wish to support
                                Internet Explorer 6-8 quirks.
                                By default UglifyJS will not try to be IE-proof.
  --support-ie8                 Use this flag to support Internet Explorer 6-8 quirks.
                                Note: may break standards compliant `catch` identifiers.
  --expr                        Parse a single expression, rather than a
                                program (for parsing JSON)
  -p, --prefix                  Skip prefix for original filenames that appear
                                in source maps. For example -p 3 will drop 3
                                directories from file names and ensure they are
                                relative paths. You can also specify -p
                                relative, which will make UglifyJS figure out
                                itself the relative paths between original
                                sources, the source map and the output file.
  -o, --output                  Output file (default STDOUT).
  -b, --beautify                Beautify output/specify output options.
  -m, --mangle                  Mangle names/pass mangler options.
  -r, --reserved                Reserved names to exclude from mangling.
  -c, --compress                Enable compressor/pass compressor options. Pass
                                options like -c
                                hoist_vars=false,if_return=false. Use -c with
                                no argument to use the default compression
                                options.
  -d, --define                  Global definitions
  -e, --enclose                 Embed everything in a big function, with a
                                configurable parameter/argument list.
  --comments                    Preserve copyright comments in the output. By
                                default this works like Google Closure, keeping
                                JSDoc-style comments that contain "@license" or
                                "@preserve". You can optionally pass one of the
                                following arguments to this flag:
                                - "all" to keep all comments
                                - a valid JS RegExp like `/foo/` or `/^!/` to
                                keep only matching comments.
                                Note that currently not *all* comments can be
                                kept when compression is on, because of dead
                                code removal or cascading statements into
                                sequences.
  --preamble                    Preamble to prepend to the output.  You can use
                                this to insert a comment, for example for
                                licensing information.  This will not be
                                parsed, but the source map will adjust for its
                                presence.
  --stats                       Display operations run time on STDERR.
  --acorn                       Use Acorn for parsing.
  --spidermonkey                Assume input files are SpiderMonkey AST format
                                (as JSON).
  --self                        Build itself (UglifyJS2) as a library (implies
                                --wrap=UglifyJS --export-all)
  --wrap                        Embed everything in a big function, making the
                                “exports” and “global” variables available. You
                                need to pass an argument to this option to
                                specify the name that your module will take
                                when included in, say, a browser.
  --export-all                  Only used when --wrap, this tells UglifyJS to
                                add code to automatically export all globals.
  --lint                        Display some scope warnings
  -v, --verbose                 Verbose
  -V, --version                 Print version number and exit.
  --noerr                       Don't throw an error for unknown options in -c,
                                -b or -m.
  --bare-returns                Allow return outside of functions.  Useful when
                                minifying CommonJS modules and Userscripts that
                                may be anonymous function wrapped (IIFE) by the
                                .user.js engine `caller`.
  --keep-fnames                 Do not mangle/drop function names.  Useful for
                                code relying on Function.prototype.name.
  --reserved-file               File containing reserved names
  --reserve-domprops            Make (most?) DOM properties reserved for
                                --mangle-props
  --mangle-props                Mangle property names (default `0`). Set to
                                `true` or `1` to mangle all property names. Set
                                to `unquoted` or `2` to only mangle unquoted
                                property names. Mode `2` also enables the
                                `keep_quoted_props` beautifier option to
                                preserve the quotes around property names and
                                disables the `properties` compressor option to
                                prevent rewriting quoted properties with dot
                                notation. You can override these by setting
                                them explicitly on the command line.
  --mangle-regex                Only mangle property names matching the regex
  --name-cache                  File to hold mangled names mappings
  --pure-funcs                  List of functions that can be safely removed if
                                their return value is not used           [array]
```

Specify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output
goes to STDOUT.

## Source map options

UglifyJS2 can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for
debugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass
`--source-map output.js.map` (full path to the file where you want the
source map dumped).

Additionally you might need `--source-map-root` to pass the URL where the
original files can be found.  In case you are passing full paths to input
files to UglifyJS, you can use `--prefix` (`-p`) to specify the number of
directories to drop from the path prefix when declaring files in the source
map.

For example:

    uglifyjs /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file1.js \
             /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file2.js \
             -o foo.min.js \
             --source-map foo.min.js.map \
             --source-map-root http://foo.com/src \
             -p 5 -c -m

The above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the
output in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`.  The source
mapping will refer to `http://foo.com/src/js/file1.js` and
`http://foo.com/src/js/file2.js` (in fact it will list `http://foo.com/src`
as the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and
`js/file2.js`).

### Composed source map

When you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as
CoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful.  Instead, you'd
like to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript).  UglifyJS has an
option to take an input source map.  Assuming you have a mapping from
CoffeeScript → compiled JS, UglifyJS can generate a map from CoffeeScript →
compressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original
location.

To use this feature you need to pass `--in-source-map
/path/to/input/source.map`.  Normally the input source map should also point
to the file containing the generated JS, so if that's correct you can omit
input files from the command line.

## Mangler options

To enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`).  The following
(comma-separated) options are supported:

- `toplevel` — mangle names declared in the toplevel scope (disabled by
  default).

- `eval` — mangle names visible in scopes where `eval` or `with` are used
  (disabled by default).

When mangling is enabled but you want to prevent certain names from being
mangled, you can declare those names with `--reserved` (`-r`) — pass a
comma-separated list of names.  For example:

    uglifyjs ... -m -r '$,require,exports'

to prevent the `require`, `exports` and `$` names from being changed.

### Mangling property names (`--mangle-props`)

**Note:** this will probably break your code.  Mangling property names is a
separate step, different from variable name mangling.  Pass
`--mangle-props`.  It will mangle all properties that are seen in some
object literal, or that are assigned to.  For example:

```js
var x = {
  foo: 1
};

x.bar = 2;
x["baz"] = 3;
x[condition ? "moo" : "boo"] = 4;
console.log(x.something());
```

In the above code, `foo`, `bar`, `baz`, `moo` and `boo` will be replaced
with single characters, while `something()` will be left as is.

In order for this to be of any use, we should avoid mangling standard JS
names.  For instance, if your code would contain `x.length = 10`, then
`length` becomes a candidate for mangling and it will be mangled throughout
the code, regardless if it's being used as part of your own objects or
accessing an array's length.  To avoid that, you can use `--reserved-file`
to pass a filename that should contain the names to be excluded from
mangling.  This file can be used both for excluding variable names and
property names.  It could look like this, for example:

```js

use `/** @const */ var`.

#### Conditional compilation, API
You can also use conditional compilation via the programmatic API. With the difference that the
property name is `global_defs` and is a compressor property:

```js
uglifyJS.minify([ "input.js"], {
    compress: {
        dead_code: true,
        global_defs: {
            DEBUG: false
        }
    }
});
```

## Beautifier options

The code generator tries to output shortest code possible by default.  In
case you want beautified output, pass `--beautify` (`-b`).  Optionally you
can pass additional arguments that control the code output:

- `beautify` (default `true`) -- whether to actually beautify the output.
  Passing `-b` will set this to true, but you might need to pass `-b` even
  when you want to generate minified code, in order to specify additional
  arguments, so you can use `-b beautify=false` to override it.
- `indent-level` (default 4)
- `indent-start` (default 0) -- prefix all lines by that many spaces
- `quote-keys` (default `false`) -- pass `true` to quote all keys in literal
  objects
- `space-colon` (default `true`) -- insert a space after the colon signs
- `ascii-only` (default `false`) -- escape Unicode characters in strings and
  regexps (affects directives with non-ascii characters becoming invalid)
- `inline-script` (default `false`) -- escape the slash in occurrences of
  `</script` in strings
- `width` (default 80) -- only takes effect when beautification is on, this
  specifies an (orientative) line width that the beautifier will try to
  obey.  It refers to the width of the line text (excluding indentation).
  It doesn't work very well currently, but it does make the code generated
  by UglifyJS more readable.
- `max-line-len` (default 32000) -- maximum line length (for uglified code)
- `bracketize` (default `false`) -- always insert brackets in `if`, `for`,
  `do`, `while` or `with` statements, even if their body is a single
  statement.
- `semicolons` (default `true`) -- separate statements with semicolons.  If
  you pass `false` then whenever possible we will use a newline instead of a
  semicolon, leading to more readable output of uglified code (size before
  gzip could be smaller; size after gzip insignificantly larger).
- `preamble` (default `null`) -- when passed it must be a string and
  it will be prepended to the output literally.  The source map will
  adjust for this text.  Can be used to insert a comment containing
  licensing information, for example.
- `quote_style` (default `0`) -- preferred quote style for strings (affects
  quoted property names and directives as well):
  - `0` -- prefers double quotes, switches to single quotes when there are
    more double quotes in the string itself.
  - `1` -- always use single quotes
  - `2` -- always use double quotes
  - `3` -- always use the original quotes
- `keep_quoted_props` (default `false`) -- when turned on, prevents stripping
  quotes from property names in object literals.

### Keeping copyright notices or other comments

You can pass `--comments` to retain certain comments in the output.  By
default it will keep JSDoc-style comments that contain "@preserve",
"@license" or "@cc_on" (conditional compilation for IE).  You can pass
`--comments all` to keep all the comments, or a valid JavaScript regexp to
keep only comments that match this regexp.  For example `--comments
'/foo|bar/'` will keep only comments that contain "foo" or "bar".

Note, however, that there might be situations where comments are lost.  For
example:
```javascript
function f() {
	/** @preserve Foo Bar */
	function g() {
	  // this function is never called
	}
	return something();
}
```

Even though it has "@preserve", the comment will be lost because the inner
function `g` (which is the AST node to which the comment is attached to) is
discarded by the compressor as not referenced.

The safest comments where to place copyright information (or other info that

});
// same as before, it returns `code` and `map`
```

If your input source map is not in a file, you can pass it in as an object
using the `inSourceMap` argument:

```javascript
var result = UglifyJS.minify("compiled.js", {
	inSourceMap: JSON.parse(my_source_map_string),
	outSourceMap: "minified.js.map"
});
```

The `inSourceMap` is only used if you also request `outSourceMap` (it makes
no sense otherwise).

To set the source map url, use the `sourceMapUrl` option.
If you're using the X-SourceMap header instead, you can just set the `sourceMapUrl` option to false.
Defaults to outSourceMap:

```javascript
var result = UglifyJS.minify([ "file1.js" ], {
  outSourceMap: "out.js.map",
  sourceMapUrl: "localhost/out.js.map"
});
```

Other options:

- `warnings` (default `false`) — pass `true` to display compressor warnings.

- `fromString` (default `false`) — if you pass `true` then you can pass
  JavaScript source code, rather than file names.

- `mangle` (default `true`) — pass `false` to skip mangling names, or pass
  an object to specify mangling options (see below).

- `mangleProperties` (default `false`) — pass an object to specify custom
  mangle property options.

- `output` (default `null`) — pass an object if you wish to specify
  additional [output options][codegen].  The defaults are optimized
  for best compression.

- `compress` (default `{}`) — pass `false` to skip compressing entirely.
  Pass an object to specify custom [compressor options][compressor].

- `parse` (default {}) — pass an object if you wish to specify some
  additional [parser options][parser]. (not all options available... see below)

##### mangle

 - `except` - pass an array of identifiers that should be excluded from mangling

 - `toplevel` — mangle names declared in the toplevel scope (disabled by
  default).

 - `eval` — mangle names visible in scopes where eval or with are used
  (disabled by default).

 - `keep_fnames` -- default `false`.  Pass `true` to not mangle
  function names.  Useful for code relying on `Function.prototype.name`.
  See also: the `keep_fnames` [compress option](#compressor-options).

  Examples:

  ```javascript
  //tst.js
  var globalVar;
  function funcName(firstLongName, anotherLongName)
  {
    var myVariable = firstLongName +  anotherLongName;
  }

  UglifyJS.minify("tst.js").code;
  // 'function funcName(a,n){}var globalVar;'

  UglifyJS.minify("tst.js", { mangle: { except: ['firstLongName'] } }).code;
  // 'function funcName(firstLongName,a){}var globalVar;'

  UglifyJS.minify("tst.js", { mangle: { toplevel: true } }).code;
  // 'function n(n,a){}var a;'
  ```

##### mangleProperties options

 - `regex` — Pass a RegExp to only mangle certain names (maps to the `--mangle-regex` CLI arguments option)
 - `ignore_quoted` – Only mangle unquoted property names (maps to the `--mangle-props 2` CLI arguments option)

We could add more options to `UglifyJS.minify` — if you need additional
functionality please suggest!

### The hard way

Following there's more detailed API info, in case the `minify` function is
too simple for your needs.

#### The parser
```javascript
var toplevel_ast = UglifyJS.parse(code, options);
```

`options` is optional and if present it must be an object.  The following
properties are available:

- `strict` — disable automatic semicolon insertion and support for trailing
  comma in arrays and objects
- `bare_returns` — Allow return outside of functions. (maps to the
  `--bare-returns` CLI arguments option and available to `minify` `parse`
  other options object)
- `filename` — the name of the file where this code is coming from
- `toplevel` — a `toplevel` node (as returned by a previous invocation of
  `parse`)

The last two options are useful when you'd like to minify multiple files and
get a single file as the output and a proper source map.  Our CLI tool does
something like this:
```javascript
var toplevel = null;
files.forEach(function(file){

- `root`: the `sourceRoot` property (see the [spec][sm-spec])
- `orig`: the "original source map", handy when you compress generated JS
  and want to map the minified output back to the original code where it
  came from.  It can be simply a string in JSON, or a JSON object containing
  the original source map.
