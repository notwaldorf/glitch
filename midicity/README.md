MIDI CITY 2000
=================
We built this city on ~~rock and roll~~ whatever music we want.

This is an interactive art experiment where MIDI songs become cities. Each **row** of buildings is an **instrument** in the song; each **building** is a **note**: the position is the time, the height is the pitch.

**You control** the density of buildings and rows. When you do this, it makes a new city and a new song. It might not be a good song, but hey: not all cities are either but we still love them.

We built this music on ~~bricks and glass~~ whatever we want.
