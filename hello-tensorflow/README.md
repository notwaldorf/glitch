hello tensorflow
=================

This is the [fit a curve to a bunch of data](https://js.tensorflow.org/tutorials/fit-curve.html) example from [TensorFlow](https://js.tensorflow.org/), but with different words, a looooooot 
more code comments, and prettier graphs. 

The [demo](https://hello-tensorflow.glitch.me/) has a lot of words about what Machine Learning is and how the algorithm works overall.

I commented basically every line of the code with what the algorithm or TensorFlow is doing (especially when
      TensorFlow is actually doing a looooot of heavy lifting behind the scenes). I hope it helps!
