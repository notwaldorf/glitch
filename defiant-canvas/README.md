I gave a talk at xoxo. These were my slides. They don't really go without the mouth
sounds I made along them, and I'll probably write a blog post. But for now, these are them.

They are silly, because that was the point.
- the "look" of the slides is randomly generated. The content is read from a json file,
put into boxes, then the boxes randomly coloured and positioned
- the demos are all iframed and take a while to load, so wait a bit.
- press <b>1</b> to see the first slide, and then the ◀️ and ▶️ arrows to advance. 
- <b>Esc</b> closes the currently open slide, <b>2</b> reopens it. 

They use web components, and I'm not using a polyfill, so they won't work on Edge/Firefox,
but they do work on Chrome/Safari. I don't feel bad about it, because I did them for my talk
and not for production, and in about 4 hours. If you make me feel bad about it, feel 
free to also fix it.

xoxo,
