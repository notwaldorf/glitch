# `<wbr>`

The HTML [<wbr>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/wbr) element represents a word break opportunity â€” a position within text where the browser may optionally break a line, though its line-breaking rules would not otherwise create a break at that location.

It's useful for many typographic things, or in this example, making secret art.
